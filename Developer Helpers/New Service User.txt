service accounts are different. They are found in sesame's service_account table. 
There is a procedure to add them. For tsbox add your service account here like the others and you can copy the hash of existing user

and then add this user as regular user as well here https://stash.dev.tradingscreen.com:7990/projects/DOCK/repos/amoeba-dev-data/browse/dev-dataset/Login

creating on the fly can be done also for testing:
for service user case (not common) duplicate existing user in sesame db: service_account table
for regular user, in admin plugin, bring up all users for 0001. Select tsclient and click copy. Then in sesame db, you have to reset force=1 to 0 for this new user and restart sesame to pick up the change right away. Try login in portal with new user
